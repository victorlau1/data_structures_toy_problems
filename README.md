# Data Structures & Toy Problems
Collection of JS and py Data Structures and Toy Problems


## PYTHON

  ++Data Structures++
    Design for the python files will be executables (i.e. python3 filename.py)
    They usually will take in parameters after the executing the file (i.e. python3 filename.py var1 var2 var3)

  ++Toy Problems++

## JAVASCRIPT

  ++Data Structures++
    Same as python, will be executables with prompts
  
  ++Toy Problems++
    Toy problems will be a node executable with pre-defined tests
  

## FUTURE

  Will add some specs for the datastructures/toy problems
